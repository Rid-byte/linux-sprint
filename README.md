# linux-sprint
Documenting my Linux and DevOps learning Sprint!

🚀 What I Learned

- Linux is case-sensitive.
- whoami → shows current user.
- id → displays user ID, group ID, and privileges.
- root → the superuser with full system access.
- sudo → SuperUser DO, lets you run admin-level tasks temporarily.
- apt update → refreshes package lists from Ubuntu servers.
- apt install htop → installs the htop system monitor.
- htop → interactive dashboard showing CPU, memory, and processes.
- Top: system stats (CPU, memory, uptime).
- Middle: running processes.
- Bottom: options (q to quit).
